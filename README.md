DBNotes
=======

DBNotes - a tool (singe webpage) to 'accumulate' database documentation. (Demo - http://screencast.com/t/UXaEGpEBduO )

Why this tool is needed?
========================
There is no database documentation usually. This tool basically allows developers to gradually add knowledge, gained over time, to one location.

UI Design
=========
Idea of Accordion on the left is from Sql Server Management Studio.
Rest of the design is modeled around StackOverflow.
